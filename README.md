# Camper
A web app to view and review campgrounds all over the world. The app was built using javascript. The project was a good opportunity to practise the CRUD functionality, authentication and authorization. I also learnt to include and manage third party packages. The project was also a good opportunity for me to look at the security aspects of building a website and how to prevent cross site scripting,sanitizing HTML and use of “helmet” package. <br />

2) User authentication and authorization    <br />
